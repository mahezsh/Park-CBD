Task 07C: Data Everywhere

Filter or alter the display of data in some way using values from the sensors on your phone/simulator.
A refresh button will need to be added or some way of your app refreshing if the values change. It
could be as simple as changing the order if the phone is orientated a particular way, or filtering nearby
locations based on the device location.
