Park CBD

Problem: Finding a parking bay is a real problem for the people who come to Melbourne city.
As one of the major cities in Australia, thousands of people come to Melbourne city daily by
private vehicles. However, finding a parking bay to park one’s own vehicle is a problem
faced by many people. Due to the limited availability of parking bays, finding a parking spot
is time consuming. Sometimes, when someone drives into a parking bay, there might be no
parking spots available. Hence, the person has to drive his/her car to another place to find an
available parking spot. Additionally, parking restrictions vary according to each parking bay.
Many people face parking fines due to not knowing the parking restrictions related to each
parking bay.
Solution: “Park CBD” will be designed as a solution to the above mentioned problem.
Proposed app contains a large dataset of On-street parking bays available in Melbourne CBD.
It contains information about more than 2,000 parking spots in the city area. Moreover, this
app uses real-time data provided by the city council in order to provide real time information
to the public. Therefore, this app can be regarded as an important source of information for
someone who’s driving to Melbourne city by his/her own vehicle. The proposed app uses a
map of the chosen area to provide details on prices and time zones, while also giving
directions to the space and prompting a user if spots are filled before their arrival.
Additionally, the app will also show parking restrictions related to each parking bay.
